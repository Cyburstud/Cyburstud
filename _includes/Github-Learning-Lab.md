##### Github-Learning-Lab

The following list of tutorials/labs to take are incredibly useful with getting familiar with github. Recommend to do all of them as soon as initially having to visit github.

* [Introduction to Github](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
* [Communication Using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)
* [Community starter kit](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/community-starter-kit)
* [GitHub Pages](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)
* [Reviewing pull requests](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests)
* [Managing merge conflicts](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts)
* [GitHub Actions: Hello World](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-hello-world)

Regretably there's no consistent flow on github's LMS so found it easier to share this way.
